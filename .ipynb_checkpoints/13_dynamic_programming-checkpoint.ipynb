    "## Dynamic Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic programming is a computer programming method developed by **Richard Bellman**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two key attributes that a problem must have in order for dynamic programming to be applicable: optimal substructure and overlapping sub-problems\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimal substructure** means that the solution to a given optimization problem can be obtained by the combination of optimal solutions to its sub-problems. Such optimal substructures are usually described by means of **recursion**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overlapping sub-problems** means that the space of sub-problems must be small, that is, any recursive algorithm solving the problem should solve the same sub-problems over and over, rather than generating new sub-problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the recursive formulation for the Fibonacci series: \n",
    "F(i) = F(i−1) + F(i−2), with base case F1 = F2 = 1. Then F43 = F42 + F41, and F42 = F41 + F40. Now F41 is being solved in the recursive sub-trees of both F43 as well as F42. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the total number of sub-problems is actually small (only 43 of them), we end up solving the same problems over and over if we adopt a naive recursive solution such as this. Dynamic programming takes account of this fact and solves each sub-problem only once. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a problem can be solved by combining optimal solutions to **non-overlapping sub-problems**, the strategy is called **\"divide and conquer\"** instead. This is why **merge sort and quick sort are not classified as dynamic programming problems**. \n",
